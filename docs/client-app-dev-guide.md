## ForgeRock Identity Edge Application Developers Guide

This guide shows you how to use the ForgeRockÂ® Identity Edge Controller (IEC) SDK to 
develop client applications and to register them with the IEC Service. The IEC SDK client 
library provides client APIs in C and [Go](https://golang.org/) for client applications to 
invoke ForgeRock Access Manager (AM) functionality through the IEC Service. The SDK library 
is small and uses a secure lightweight messaging protocol so that it can run on constrained 
devices.

The examples in this Guide use the C API. Adjust the examples if you are using Go.

### Before You Start
Before you start developing clients, it is helpful to have an overview of the IEC and its 
components. Read the official [IEC Documentation](http://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/iec/6.5/) 
as a starting point.

The code examples in this guide assume that you are using the 
[IEC training environment](https://github.com/ForgeRock/identity-edge-controller-docs/tree/master/training). 
If you are not using the training environment, make sure that you have installed all the 
required components, including the IEC SDK, and that everything is up and running, as 
described in the [IEC Installation Guide](http://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/iec/6.5/install-guide). 
Also make sure that you have set the `LIBRARY_PATH` variables, as described in 
[To Install the SDK](http://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/iec/6.5/install-guide/index.html#install-sdk).  
Adjust the examples for your environment.

The IEC Service attests for both clients (SDK) and devices. Onboarding either of these node 
types will fail if the IEC Service has not registered successfully with AM. In general, the 
functional flow is from the SDK Client library (`libiecclient.so`) API, via ZMQ and the IEC 
Service to the AM IEC Plugin and back.

For details of the IEC components and how they interact, see the 
[IEC Getting Started Guide](http://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/iec/6.5/getting-started).

Log in to the AM Admin Console. The default credentials for the AM admin user in the training 
environment are `amadmin` and `password`. The training environment already has a configured realm 
named `edge`. If you are not using the training environment, configure this realm, as described in 
[Configuring AM for IoT](http://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/iec/6.5/install-guide/index.html#am-iot-config). 

### About the Build Script

The SDK includes a `build-examples.sh` script that sets the required environment variables and builds 
all applications that are in the following directories:
  
<pre>~/forgerock/examples/<i>app-name</i></pre>

The build script creates applications named *app-name* in the corresponding 
`~/forgerock/examples/app-name` directory.
   
Before you use the script, open it in a text editor and adjust the path to your local C compiler, 
for example:

```export CC=usr/bin/gcc```
  
Make sure that the script is executable.  

### Initializing Clients With the IEC SDK

The IEC SDK requires access to a configuration to provide keys, URLs, and so on. After you 
have installed and registered the IEC Service, you can initialise this configuration in two 
ways:

* Manually, using a JSON configuration file and the `iecutil` utility.
 
  `iecutil` creates a configuration database (named `iec-sdk.db`) based on the properties 
  in this configuration JSON file.

  A sample configuration file follows:
  ```{
       "zmq_client": {
         "endpoint": "tcp://127.0.0.1:5556",
         "secret_key":"zZZfS7BthsFLMv$]Zq{tNNOtd69hfoBsuc-lg1cM",
         "public_key":"uH&^{aIzDw5<>TRbHcu0q#(zo]uLl6Wyv/1{/^C+",
         "server_public_key":"9m27tKf3aoNWQ(G-f[>W]gP%f&+QxPD:?mX*)hdJ",
         "msg_timeout_sec": 5
       },
       "logging": {
         "enabled": true,
         "debug": true,
         "max_file_size_mb": 5,
         "max_backup_files": 5,
         "max_file_age_days": 0,
         "compress_file_backups": true
       },
       "client_configuration": {
         "id": "iec-client"
       }
     }
  ```
  The configuration database *must* exist for the ZMQ communication to be established. Once 
  the database exists, you can update it from AM through the IEC Service. For security 
  reasons, you should delete or protect the JSON configuration file once the client has been 
  initialized. 
  
* Dynamically, using the `iec_set_attribute` function to set individual attribute values.

  Dynamic configuration takes precedence over a database configuration, if one exists. You 
  can use the `iec_set_attribute` utility to set a number of configuration attribute values, such 
  as the `IEC_ENDPOINT` and `IEC_SECRETKEY`. For a list of all the attributes, see 
  [libiectypes.h](https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/IOT/repos/identity-edge-controller-core/browse/cmd/iecsdk/libiectypes.h).
  
#### Example 1: Initializing a Client Manually

To initialize the client manually:

1. Your C application must include the `libiecclient.h` library and a call to `iec_initialise()`.

   See the example client application [init_sdk_static.c](../training/sdk/examples/init_sdk_static/init_sdk_static.c).
   
2. Create a new directory in the `~/forgerock/examples` directory, with the same name as your client 
application and place the C application in that directory.

   For example, to build the `init_sdk_static.c` application, copy 
   [init_sdk_static.c](../training/sdk/examples/init_sdk_static/init_sdk_static.c) into a new directory 
   named `init_sdk_static`:
   
   ```
   mkdir ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static
   cp init_sdk_static.c ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static
   ```
   
3. Run the build script to set the build variables and build the application:

   ```~/forgerock/build-examples.sh```
   
   The build script creates the application `init_sdk_static` in the `~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static` 
   directory:
   
   ```
   ls examples/init_sdk_static/
   init_sdk_static  init_sdk_static.c
   ```
   
4. Copy the database configuration file (`sdk-config.json`) to the directory containing your 
application. For example:

   ```
   cp ~/forgerock/sdk-config.json ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static
   ```
   
5. Edit the database configuration file to specify the IP address on which the SDK runs. For example, 
if you are setting this up in the training environment, edit the file as follows:

   `zmq_client.endpoint: tcp://172.16.0.11:5556`
   
6. Change to the directory in which your client application is located, then use the IEC utility to 
initialize the client application, based on the database configuration file in that directory:

   ```
   cd ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static
   ~/forgerock/iecutil -file sdk-config.json -initialise sdk
   iec util: Initialising sdk
   iec util: Finished sdk initialisation
   ```
   
   An SDK application looks in the directory from which it's run for a configuration database or for a 
   file that contains the database location.
   
   **Note** If you change the configuration and need to reinitialize the SDK, remove the 
  `iec-sdk.db` in the application directory, then run the initialization again.
  
7. Run the example application:

   ```
   cd ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static
   ./init_sdk_static
   ```
   
   If the initialization was successful, you should see the `iec-client` identity in the AM Console.

#### Example 2: Initializing a Client Dynamically

If you are running this example after the previous example, delete the configuration file and database 
(`sdk-config.json` and `iec-sdk.db`) from the `~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_static` directory.

To initialize the client dynamically:

1. Your C application must include the `libiecclient.h` library, and provide the complete SDK 
configuration with the `iec_set_attribute()` function.

   See the example client application [init_sdk_dynamic.c](../training/sdk/examples/init_sdk_dynamic/init_sdk_dynamic.c).
   
2. Create a new directory in the `~/forgerock/examples` directory, with the same name as your client 
  application and place the C application in that directory.
  
   For example, to build the `init_sdk_dynamic.c` application, copy 
   [init_sdk_dynamic.c](../training/sdk/examples/init_sdk_static/init_sdk_dynamic.c) into a new 
   directory named `init_sdk_dynamic`:
   
   ```
   mkdir ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_dynamic
   cp init_sdk_dynamic.c ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_dynamic
   ```
  
3. Run the build script to set the build variables and build the application:

   `~/forgerock/build-examples.sh`
   
   The build script creates the application `init_sdk_dynamic` in the 
   `~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_dynamic` directory:
   
   ```
   ls examples/init_sdk_dynamic/
   init_sdk_dynamic init_sdk_dynamic.c
   ```

4. Run the example application:

   ```
   cd ~/forgerock/examples/init_sdk_dynamic
   ./init_sdk_dynamic
   *** Initialising the SDK dynamically
   *** SDK function(s): iec_initialise
   
   Setting dynamic attributes... Done
   
   Initialising sdk... Done
   ```
   
   If the initialization was successful, you should see the `iec-dynamic-client` identity in the AM 
   Console.
