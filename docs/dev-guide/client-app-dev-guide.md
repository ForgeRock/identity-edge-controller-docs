## ForgeRock Identity Edge Application Developers Guide

This guide shows you how to use the ForgeRockÂ® Identity Edge Controller (IEC) SDK to 
develop client applications and to register them with the IEC Service. The IEC SDK client 
library provides client APIs in C and [Go](https://golang.org/) for client applications to 
invoke ForgeRock Access Manager (AM) functionality through the IEC Service. The SDK library 
is small and uses a secure lightweight messaging protocol so that it can run on constrained 
devices.

The examples in this Guide use the C API. Adjust the examples if you are using Go.
